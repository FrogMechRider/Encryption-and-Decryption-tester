# Encryption and Decryption Tester

Made for beginners to visualize what encryption looks like. Provides output of encryption in ciphertext and the decryption of plaintext. Test Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption; Hashing; File encryption and decryption (NOTE: Encrypting your file will delete the original file. Do not use on sensitive or important files.)

# Installation

```
pip install cryptography

git clone https://github.com/FrogMechRider/Encryption-and-Decryption-tester.git

cd Encryption-and-Decryption-tester

```

# Usage

```
python Encryption_and_Decryption.py

```

Data Encryption and Decryption Tool
1. Symmetric Encryption (AES)
2. Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)
3. Hashing (SHA-256)
4. File Encryption
5. File Decryption
6. Exit

Choose an option:

1. Symmetric encryption:

Enter plaintext: FrogMechRider

Ciphertext: b'\x18%\x14C\xd2\xc5\xddMTt\x03\xc4\xde\xd3\xf2Z\xc0\xa2\x1a\x0f\xdf -q\xa2%\xb75w\xce}\xa1'

Decrypted text: FrogMechRider

### note: When encrypting a file, the new file with end with ".enc". Keep that in mind when decrypting your file.
